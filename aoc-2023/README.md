# aoc-2023

My solutions to Advent of Code 2023 puzzles. This year in Clojure at least for starters.

## Installation

Install Leiningen (the build tool needed for building the project) https://leiningen.org/#install

## Usage

Program for each day can be run like on the example below. Puzzle input is read from standard input.

```sh
lein with-profile day-01 run < input-data-01.txt
```
